This is a Sleep Calculator made to help me figure out how much sleep I'm getting in a week and how it makes me feel.

It's a very rudimentary function right now. Nothing interesting. Eventually it will incorporate an HTML Table and User Authorization. A not-too complicated Full-Stack Application with a very practical purpose!
